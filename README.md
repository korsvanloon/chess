# Chess app

This project is an implementation of chess.

It features displaying hints on what tiles are being attacked by who and keeping track of the history of moves.
On the right side in the game you will see the move history.
When hovering, you will see the current state.
Clicking that move will keep that state visible.
Double-clicking resets the game to that point in time.
You can also just redo the last move.

See it live in action on [https://korsvanloon.github.io/chess](https://korsvanloon.github.io/chess)
